## Abstract

**Role: Project Lead**

Step MPS (Mind-Paced Speaking) is a revolutionary brain-inspired proprietary framework designed to endow speech large models with truly human-like abilities to "think while speaking." Its core innovation lies in the "dual-brain" architecture: a "planning brain" responsible for high-level logical reasoning that guides a separate "expression brain" in real-time for fluent speech generation. This collaborative division of labor represents the world's first solution to the fundamental contradiction between complex "chain-of-thought" reasoning and real-time interaction. It achieves zero latency increase while maintaining virtually full reasoning accuracy, thereby granting the model genuine advanced logical intelligence and empathetic interactive capabilities, ultimately achieving seamless synchronization between thinking and expression.
