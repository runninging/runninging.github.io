  #       I am an Audio LLM Researcher at StepFun, specializing in advanced speech technologies. My research focuses on speech understanding, interactive speech systems, the unification of understanding and generation, and the application of reinforcement learning within the speech domain.

  #       I have been a key contributor to several pioneering large-scale speech models, including Step-Audio, Step-Audio 2, Step-MPS, and Step-Audio R1, which have significantly advanced the frontiers of speech AI.
