**项目简介：**

Step-Audio 2 is an end-to-end multimodal large language model engineered for industrial applications. This model innovatively integrates a latent space audio encoder with audio reinforcement learning.

**关键特性：**
- Genuine end-to-end architecture eliminating traditional ASR+LLM+TTS pipelines
- CoT-reinforcement learning fusion enabling audio reasoning capabilities
- Acoustic knowledge enhancement via web search and audio retrieval
- SOTA performance on MMAU, URO-Bench, and multiple ASR benchmarks
